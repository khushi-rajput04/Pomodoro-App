# Pomodoro-App

Pomodoro is a simple GUI-based Pomodoro timer application created using Tkinter and Pygame. It helps you stay focused and productive by breaking your work into intervals of focused work (25 minutes) followed by short breaks (5 minutes), with a longer break (20 minutes) after every 4 work sessions.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer:** The app follows the classic Pomodoro technique with 25 minutes of work session followed by a 5-minute break. After 4 work sessions, it triggers a longer break of 20 minutes.
- **Sound Alerts:** Pomodoro plays a bell sound at the beginning and end of each session, helping you keep track of time even when the app is running in the background.
- **Desktop Notifications:** When each session ends, the app pops up a window on top of other active applications, ensuring you don't miss the transition between work and break sessions.
